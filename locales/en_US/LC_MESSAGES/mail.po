"We are writing you this message because you have supported us with a donation in the past years, and we felt like informing you of some important issues:\n\n"
"First of all, the system we set up to send the electronic and physical versions of the \"pi-plomas\", as well as the \"pi-shirts\", is –like the rest of La Quadrature– made up of humans, dirty code and good will... Which means it sometimes fails (and this is how we learn! ;) If for some reason you didn't receive your \"Pi-ploma\", here it is, re-issued in electronic form. If for some reason you didn't receive your thank you gifts by physical mail, please let us know by replying to this message and we will look into it.\n\n"
"%%URL%%\n\n"
"Also, you may be aware that we just launched a new fundraising campaign. La Quadrature du Net has been informing about ACTA for the past four years, and now that the final steps lay right before us (INTA committee's vote on its report on June 21st, and the final vote in plenary in early July!), we are once again at risk: our financial situation may force us to stop funding full-time staff as early as in August or September, and therefore be unable to do as much as we do today... We know you are already aware of the importance of the fight we are leading against ACTA, but please keep in mind that most important is the post-ACTA world we are already preparing, the positive agenda that we have an occasion to push for.\n\n"
"http://support.laquadrature.net\n\n"
"You can help us win the ACTA battle and push forward with our ideas and values for a free and open society, against control and repression. \n\n"
"You can participate by spreading our fundraising campaign on your blogs, social networks, and in your organisations and various circles. \n\n"
"Because La Quadrature du Net is not much more than the sum of the individuals involved and the energy spent, we count on your precious support. \n\n"
