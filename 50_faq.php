			<div><p>
			    Spread the word about this campaign! By speaking up on social networks, on blogs, or by telling people around you about the importance of La Quadrature's actions,  and how they can participate, you can help us. This support is vital, as La Quadrature can only exist through the citizens who share our commitment to the free Internet.
			    You can also support La Quadrature du Net day after day by <a href="http://laquadrature.net/en/how-to-participate">getting involved</a>.
				Financial donations help la Quadrature work on a day-to-day basis by paying for its fulltime activists'  salaries, costs and such, but la Quadrature would be nothing without the people who give their time, skills and energy to support its actions  and make them their own.
				Please don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/fr/contact">get in touch</a> to find a way to contribute that suits you!

			    Yes. To donate by check, stop the payment procedure just after you click on the “I support La Quadrature du Net” button. Once you reach the donation summary, do not click on the “proceed with your payment” button.
			    Send your check to the following address:
			    <table class="formv"> 
			      <tr><td><i>Payable to: </i></td><td>FDNN</td></tr> 
			      <tr><td><i>Address: </i></td><td>FDNN, 16 rue de Cachy, 80090 Amiens</td></tr> 
			      <tr><td><b>Important note: </b></td><td>Please write down the name you gave us on the back of your check in order to allow us to find you easily.</td></tr> 
			    </table> 
			    FDNN (Fond de Défense de la Net Neutralité, “Net Neutrality Defense Fund”), is the organisation which manages La Quadrature du Net's accounts.

			  Do not worry! To minimise the time we spend processing checks, these are  processed in batch. You should receive your pi digits (and other gifts depending on your donation) within a few days. </div> 
			<h4 id="faq-virement-transfert"><a href="#faq-virement-transfert">Can I make a donation through money transfer?</a> </h4>

			<h4 id="faq-paypal"><a href="#faq-paypal">Can I make a donation through PayPal?</a></h4>
			<div><p>We  do not recommend using PayPal for donations, for ethical reasons (their actions against WikiLeaks, among others) and because of the overtly expensive costs incurred. Nevertheless, if it is your only option, you  may use the following account: paypal@laquadrature.net.
