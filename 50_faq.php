			<div>
			    <br/>Spread the word about this campaign! By speaking up on social networks, on blogs, or by telling people around you about the importance of La Quadrature's actions,  and how they can participate, you can help us. This support is vital, as La Quadrature can only exist through the citizens who share our commitment to the free Internet.
			    <br/>You can also support La Quadrature du Net day after day by <a target="_blank" href="http://laquadrature.net/en/how-to-participate"><span class="lien-faq">getting involved</span></a>.
			    <br/>Financial donations help la Quadrature work on a day-to-day basis by paying for its fulltime activists'  salaries, costs and such, but la Quadrature would be nothing without the people who give their time, skills and energy to support its actions  and make them their own.
			    <br/>Please don't hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laquadrature.net/en/contact-us"><span class="lien-faq">get in touch</span></a> to find a way to contribute that suits you!
			</div>
			<h4 id="faq-tax"><a href="#faq-tax">Is my support tax-deductible?</a> </h4>

			<h4 id="faq-cheque"><a href="#faq-cheque">Can I make a donation by check?</a></h4>
			<div>
			    Yes. To donate by check, stop the payment procedure just after you click on the “I support La Quadrature du Net” button. Once you reach the donation summary, do not click on the “proceed with your payment” button.
			    Send your check to the following address:<br/>
			    <br/><table class="formv"> 
			      <tr><td><i>Payable to: </i></td><td>FDNN</td></tr> 
			      <tr><td><i>Address: </i></td><td>FDNN, 16 rue de Cachy, 80090 Amiens</td></tr> 
			      <tr><td><b>Important note: </b></td><td>Please write down the name you gave us on the back of your check in order to allow us to find you easily.</td></tr> 
			    </table> <br/>
			    FDNN (Fond de Défense de la Net Neutralité, “Net Neutrality Defense Fund”), is the organisation which manages La Quadrature du Net's accounts.
			</div>
			<h4 id="faq-virement-transfert"><a href="#faq-virement-transfert">Can I make a donation through money transfer?</a> </h4>
			<div id="faq0" >

			</div>
			<h4 id="faq-paypal"><a href="#faq-paypal">Can I make a donation through PayPal?</a></h4>
			<div>We  do not recommend using PayPal for donations, for ethical reasons (their actions against WikiLeaks, among others) and because of the overtly expensive costs incurred. Nevertheless, if it is your only option, you  may use the following account: paypal@laquadrature.net.
			</div>
			<h4 id="faq-flattr"><a href="#faq-flattr">Can I make a donation via Flattr?</a> </h4>
			<div id="faq10" > 
			<br/>Yes! If you wish to support la Quadrature via Flattr, you can simply flatter this page, or any of the site's articles.
			<br/>Flattr  is a great way to support us, but as a Flattr is quite small, please  don't hesitate to flatter our articles to your heart's content.
<a href="http://flattr.com/thing/129120/La-Quadrature-du-Net"><img src="/files/flattr-compact.png" title="Flattr this" alt="Flattr" />
</a>
			<br/>Flattr  also offers the possibility to make larger donations, which offers an  interesting alternative to PayPal.<br/>To make a donation to La  Quadrature du Net via Flattr, please use  <a target="_blank" href="https://flattr.com/donation/give/to/laquadrature"><span class="lien-faq">the form on this page</span></a>. As Flattr donations are anonymous, we will not be able to send you your goodies, unless you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laquadrature.net/en/contact-us"><span class="lien-faq">contact us</span></a> with identifiable information, and in particular the the amount you plan to give in your donation.

			<h4 id="faq-buy-t-shirts"><a href="#faq-buy-t-shirts">Can I support La Quadrature du Net by buying a t-shirt?</a> </h4>
			<div>
			La Quadrature du Net does not sell t-shirts. The only way to support la Quadrature du Net (financially) is to make a donation. Of course, you can also help and support la Quadrature in other ways, by helping out for instance. Selling t-shirts would require a lot of time and effort and would probably mean hiring someone in order to make anything substantial from it. It would not be worth it. The pi-shirts are but a (small) gift from la Quadrature to show its gratitude and thank its most generous benefactors.
			</div>
			<h4 id="faq-when-t-shirts"><a href="#faq-when-t-shirts">When will I get my shirt?</a> </h4>
			<div id="faq7" > 
			For logistical reasons, t-shirts are sent in batch. This may take a while, sometimes up to a couple months. Please forgive us for this delay.
